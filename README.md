# ft_linear_regression

The aim of this project is to introduce you to the basic concept behind machine learning. For this project, you will have to create a program that predicts the price of a car by using a linear function train with a gradient descent algorithm. You are also free to use any libraries you want as long as they do not do all the work for you. For example, the use of pythonâ€™s numpy.polyfit is considered cheating.
